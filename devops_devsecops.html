          <p>DevOps and DevSecOps are modern approaches to software development and deployment that emphasize collaboration and efficiency, but they differ significantly in how they handle security.</p>
          
          <h3>DevOps</h3>
          <p>DevOps is a software development approach that integrates development and operations teams to streamline and accelerate the software delivery process. Its primary focus is on improving collaboration, automation, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) to ensure faster and more reliable releases.</p>
          
          <h4>Key Aspects of DevOps:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Collaboration and Culture:</strong> DevOps fosters a collaborative environment where development and operations teams work closely to deploy code quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Focuses heavily on automating repetitive tasks, including testing, deployment, and monitoring, to speed up the software release cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):</strong> Ensures that code changes are tested and deployed frequently, allowing for rapid iteration and feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability and Efficiency:</strong> Emphasizes system stability and performance, often through automated monitoring and incident response systems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Achieve faster software development and deployment cycles by enhancing collaboration and automating processes.</p>

          <h3>DevSecOps</h3>
          <p>DevSecOps builds upon DevOps by integrating security practices into the development lifecycle. This approach ensures that security is a shared responsibility and not an afterthought. DevSecOps embeds security checks and balances into every phase of the CI/CD pipeline, promoting a culture of "security as code."</p>
          
          <h4>Key Aspects of DevSecOps:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Security Integration:</strong> Security tools and practices are embedded into every stage of the development and deployment process.</li>
            <li><strong>Shift-Left Security:</strong> Emphasizes identifying and addressing security issues early in the development process to prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation of Security Testing:</strong> Integrates security scans, vulnerability assessments, and compliance checks into CI/CD pipelines, making security a continuous process.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration Across Teams:</strong> DevSecOps promotes collaboration among development, operations, and security teams, creating a shared responsibility for security.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Ensure security is an integral part of the software lifecycle, reducing risks and vulnerabilities in production.</p>

          <h2>Differences in Focus and Objectives</h2>
          <table>
            <tr><th>Aspect</th><th>DevOps</th><th>DevSecOps</th></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Primary Focus</strong></td><td>Speed and reliability in deployment</td><td>Security integrated into development</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Approach to Security</strong></td><td>Security as a separate process, often post-deployment</td><td>Security embedded throughout the development cycle</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Key Tools</strong></td><td>CI/CD, automation tools, monitoring</td><td>CI/CD, security tools, vulnerability scanners</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Process</strong></td><td>Development and operations integration</td><td>Development, operations, and security integration</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Goal</strong></td><td>Efficient and reliable software delivery</td><td>Secure and compliant software delivery</td></tr>
          </table>

          <h2>How They Work Together</h2>
          <p>DevSecOps builds on the principles of DevOps by embedding security into the development process, ensuring that security is not an afterthought. By integrating security checks within the CI/CD pipeline, DevSecOps allows for faster, more secure releases, creating a balance between speed and security.</p>
